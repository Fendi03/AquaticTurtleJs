Turtle
Description
This is a simple JavaScript implementation of a swimming and diving turtle. The code defines a Turtle class with attributes such as name, color, and speed. It also includes methods for swimming (swim()) and diving (dive(depth)), allowing the turtle to exhibit these behaviors.

Usage
To use this code, simply instantiate a Turtle object with a name, color, and speed. Then, you can call the swim() method to make the turtle swim gracefully and the dive(depth) method to make it dive to a specific depth in meters.

Example
javascript
Copy code
const myTurtle = new Turtle('Terry', 'Green', 'slow');
myTurtle.swim();
myTurtle.dive(10);
This will create a turtle named Terry, with green color and slow speed, and then demonstrate its swimming and diving actions.
